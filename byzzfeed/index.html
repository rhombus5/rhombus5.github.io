        <h2>What Makes a Woman?</h2>
        <p>
          Is she an unfinished man? Is Nature ‚Äúdeeply ashamed when she sees that
          she has created such an imperfect body‚Äù? Heck no! Women are created in
          the image of God, and so ladies, don‚Äôt be ashamed! They are created
          from noble material, not crude matter. They have the authority of God
          to nurture, and we see that over and over again throughout history.
          Men may be the muscle of civilization, but women are the heart. If men
          are blunt, women are sharp. They consistently prove to be the real
          power. Here following will be a list of girls that prove they deserve
          respect‚Äîcheck your misogyny at the door!

        <h3><strong>5.</strong> Veturia of Rome</h3>

          A noble lady and the mother of Gnaeus Marcius, she defended Rome from
          destruction. After her son was banished and exiled for not being able
          to please everyone, he became angry. Marcius was ready to take on Rome
          and teach them a lesson for what they‚Äôd done by marching on Rome with
          a group of rebels. In a moment of desperation, the women of Rome met
          with Veturia and told her what was up. Lady Veturia went to go and
          remind her son who he was, leading all the ladies. She stood in front
          of her son and begged him to make peace. Like the good son he was, he
          replied, ‚ÄúA mother should not have to beg her son: she should command
          him.‚Äù He turned around and all was well because she had a mother‚Äôs
          heart and raised her son right.

        <h3><strong>4.</strong> Saint Christine</h3>

          Okay, maybe it‚Äôs a bit cheesy to pick someone who shares my name, but
          there is nothing cheesy about this queen. She ignored her father
          Urban‚Äôs idols and found the true Lord. She once sold them to care for
          the poor and needy she saw around her. Because she defended the Lord
          even to terrible torture, she was baptized by the Lord Jesus Christ
          Himself. She then fought against the idol-worshipping judges that
          tried to take her dignity. With an indomitable spirit and God‚Äôs grace,
          she was protected from deadly serpents and brought a man back to life.
          For praising God, her tongue was cut out, and she spat what was left
          in the face of the tyrant Julian. It doesn‚Äôt get more girlboss than
          that. She had a theophany and died a martyr. She was firm and
          steadfast her whole life, always looking to help others because she
          was locked in on serving God.

        <h3><strong>3.</strong> Nicostrata of Arcadia</h3>

        <p>
          God gave Nicostrata, sometimes known as Carmentis, great gifts of
          knowledge, making her an academic weapon. It was rumored by some of
          her time that her lover was the god Mercury because she was so smart.
          She laid the foundation for Rome not just by settling in Mount
          Palatine, but also its laws. She made Italy the cradle of all
          laws‚Äîmomma energy for real. She‚Äôs also the mother of the Latin
          alphabet and its grammar, the ones we use today! Without her sharp
          wisdom, we would not have the world we do today.

        <h3><strong>2.</strong> Minerva of Greece</h3>
        <img

        />
        <p class="image-credit">Image: Statue of Minerva ‚Äì Britannica.com</p>
        <p>
          Minerva, sometimes known as Pallas, was a girl so smart, the other
          Greeks sometimes thought she was a goddess walking among them. This
          girl could do anything. She invented the Greek alphabet with her sharp
          mind. Speaking of sharp, she invented sheepshearing and weaving,
          keeping us warm with all the great fabrics we have today. She
          discovered oil to keep us warm and give us light and wind instruments
          to entertain us. Reinvent the wheel? This girl invented the cart and
          wagon to make carrying things easier. She kept knights and soldiers
          safe with iron and steel armor using new furnaces and metallurgy
          techniques. We need more women like Minerva because she gave us so
          many wonderful things we can‚Äôt live without. She spent her life making
          things to take care of us.

        <h3><strong>1.</strong> Mother Mary</h3>

        <p>
          We can‚Äôt end a list about the women who best embody the nurturing
          spirit and the authority of God without talking about Mother Mary. She
          is the reason that Salvation came to the children of men! Even if all
          other women were wicked, she has the light to eclipse their evil, and
          did she let it shine! She‚Äôs part of your day today, just as the angel
          Gabriel hailed her then, so too you hail her now. She is the ideal
          woman because she raised our Lord and prepared Him to save us from our
          sins.

        <h2>Why This Order?</h2>
        <p>
          I started off with Veturia because she sets the standard for being
          there for your country when they need you and showing others what is
          right. We build up with Saint Christine because she gave her life to
          serving others in her small way, even at the face of death. Nicostrata
          of Arcadia mothered law and language, then Minerva of Greece added
          progress and protection. At the top of it all, we have the Queen of
          Heaven, Mother Mary, the nurturer of our Salvation. All these women
          show what it means to be a woman: smart and sharp to bring us forward
          and never leaving us behind with their care. They grew our world with
          one good deed at a time, and so can any woman. They‚Äôre all made in the
          image of God after all. Share this if you agree and let me know: who‚Äôs
          on your top five?
